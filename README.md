### Problem definiton and Solution 

##### Identification of the *problem* 

- Australia  is known for its beautiful and vast scenery. It is part of the Australian way of living to be active and spend time outdoors. In NSW there are so many stuning camping spots.

###### storage is a problem in cities like sydney 

- The high cost of living in big cities like Sydney for those are not home owners space and storage can be a big issue. Most people in Sydney only have enough space for essentials, and the idea of storing camping equipment that they are only going to use once or twice a year seems nonsensical. 

###### camping requires a lot of gear it can be expensive 

- For others with a genuine interest in exploring and going on adventures on the weekends that lack storage space and are concerned about money.

##### Solution 

Campingo aims to solve this problem by:

- Matching those who own camping gear and those interested in renting camping gear only for a specific trip or period of time. 
- Allowing people with an interest in camping or who want to explore a particular spot to rent the equipment they need for their adventure without having to spend a fortune.
- Allowing people who own camping gear and equipment to rent it out when they are not using it.

Campingo is a website that aims people with an interest and inclination in outdoors adventures and camping who do not own or have all the neccesary equiment to encur in such activities. Campingo is a two sided marketplace in that it allows some users (rentees or buyers) to buy or rent camping gear suited for their specific adventures, and other users (renters or sellers) to sell and rent their camping gear when they are not using it.

  Rentees and renters are able to communicate each other to discuss and arrage pick up location.

- ##### Image upload 

  Renters can upload images to their listings. 

- ##### Autentication & Autorization

  Users access their profile by entering their and password. Depending on the type of profile they have they will have different authorization and access for example

  	- Rentees: would be able to see all listings but they won't be able to edit, update, or delete, them. 
  	- Renters: would be able to create as many listings as they wish and to have all CRUD functionality to their own listings.

  Each listing has a rental price per day or night and a deposit fee that would be returned to the rentee when they return the item(s).
